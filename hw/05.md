# Week 5

### Make your own CSS framework

1. Use scss or less and compile down to css
    * Submit both the .scss and .css file
2. Framework can use grid or flex or float based layout with 12 columns
3. Framework should have styles set for
    * Buttons (think about setting padding and overflow defaults on these)
    * Lists (think about margins and font-sizes here)
    * h1, h2, h3 (again, font-sizes and margins)
    * p
    * links (think about defaults for the different states here)
4. Framework should have at least two breakpoints (aka media queries): mobile + desktop
5. Framework should use BEM
