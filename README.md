## Course prerequisites

Basic computer knowledge. Basic familiarity with any programming/scripting language is preferred but no required.

## Course description

Intro to Web Development is a live-coding and discussion course focused on HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

We will examining some history of the web, and explore integration of three of it's main components: the content (html), the presentation (css), and the behavior (javascript). We will evaluate some of the ways in which people structure the content and create styled and interactive webpages.

This course employs three interconnected practices: reading, talking and coding. The first objective is to expose you to a wide range of readings and code exercises that deal with the structure and function of the web. Engaging in discussion with your peers is crucial to the creation of a learning community. The structure of this course will reinforce that, showing that what you see and find is not what others see and find. Student led discussions are perhaps the most important part. The course will not be dominated by the professor.

## Course Structure
Class time will be spent on lecture, live-coding, Q&A, and student facilitations. Assignments will consist of online tutorials as well as weekly projects that build on each week’s topics of discussion.

## Software to get in advance
* Browser: Chrome
* Github Account: github.com/join

## Grading

### 40% - Class Participation + Short Weekly Assignments

  Consists of three components: attendance, contributions to discussions, and graded assignments. Please do not underestimate the effect that each element will have on your final grade.
  
  Attendance and active participation in discussion is a requirement. If you don't show up, you can't participate. If you know you must miss a class, email me with `Name: ABSENT-yyyy-mm-dd` in the subject line before the class. You are responsible for doing all the exercises on time and showing up with questions and ideas that contribute to the learning community.
  
  Weekly assignments will be submitted on GitHub and will be given a + (sufficient), ++ (extra effort), or a - (insufficient effort). If you receive a -, you will need to redo the assignment before the next week.


**PLEASE NOTE: 3 unexcused absences will result in your grade dropping 10%**

### 30% - Peer Facilitation

Leading Class Discussion. Presentations are an opportunity for a student to structure and facilitate the discussion of an assigned activity.
Please see the [facilitation guide](facilitation.md) for more information.

### 30% - Final Project

You will be building a website using html, css and javascript. It can be a game, a content site, an artistic rendering done with css. I highly suggest starting work on this early. You must submit a title, brief description, short outline and tech component list by November 15th.
 
## Qualitative Grading Overview

Each student will be judged on the quality, experimentation, and improvement that their work shows.

### A. Very Good (90-100)

Performance, participation, and attendance of the student has been of the highest level, showing sustained excellence in meeting course responsibilities. Work clearly differentiates itself from other work, has memorable impact, pursues concepts and techniques above and beyond what is discussed in class.

### B. Good (80-89)

Performance, participation, and attendance of the student has been good, though not of the highest level. Work demonstrates a better than average web design and development process.

### C. Average (70-79)

Performance and attendance of the student has been adequate, satisfactorily meeting the course requirements. Work is average, showing a basic understanding of the web development process.

### D. Poor (60-69)

Performance and attendance of the student has been less than adequate. Work is lacking in many or most areas. Problems may include lack of interest, procrastination, poor planning and poor craft.

### F. Unacceptable (59 & Below)

Performance and attendance of the student has been such that course requirements have not been met. Work shows no overall understanding of the course material on many levels.

## Academic Honesty

All work for this class must be your own and specific to this semester. Any work recycled from other classes or from another, non-original source will be rejected with serious implications for the student. Plagiarism, knowingly representing the words or ideas of another as one’s own work in any academic exercise, is absolutely unacceptable. Any student who commits plagiarism must re-do the assignment for a grade no higher than a D. In fact, a D is the highest possible course grade for any student who commits plagiarism.

## Accommodations

If you are student with a disability who is requesting accommodations, please
 contact New York University’s Moses Center for Students with Disabilities at 1-212-998-4980 or mosescsd@nyu.edu.  You must be registered with CSD to receive accommodations.
