### 30% - Final
For your final project, you'll be creating a portfolio, or website. You may not use a framework for the layout. 
All CSS **must be from you**. If you have a different idea you'd like to implement, go ahead-- just be sure there are
5 pages and they include the reqs or equal work effort as below.

The site must be 5 pages:
 
1. Home
2. About the Author
3. Photo Gallery flowing grid of thumbnails that expand when clicked on
4. Media page that includes audio or video and custom controls to play it
5. Styled page of blog posts that show a screenshot of your homework each 
week and something you learned.

Over all the pages must include:

* Navigation Bar
* Flex or grid layout (or both!)
* Float & float shape
* Clean, cascading css with proper BEM names
    * Likely this means multiple css files to keep clean separation (use @import)
* Semantic HTML (no divitis)
* Semantic classnames
* @media-queries to support an iphoneX as rendered in the Chrome dev tools
    * should work for portrait and landscape
    * mobile navigation that slides in or down
* Add touch gestures to something with https://hammerjs.github.io/
* Keyframes
* Gradients
* Multimedia element + handmade controls
* Must be accessible (use aria, colors that show up for colorblind, smart dom vs visual layout)
* Render a photo gallery on click of an element         
    * Data can come from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/photos or your own photo api
